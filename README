The directory contains the bib resources of the KWARC group, most 
notably the citation database kwarc.bib. 

There is also various bst (bibTeX style files), most notably the ones for 
for hyperrefed citations in alpha.bst. More can be generated by editing 
the makefile. 
 
At the moment we have alphahurl.bst 

To make use of these add something like the following to your environment variables. 

# BibTeX
export BIBINPUTS=".:${HOME}/kwarc/doc/bibs"
export BSTINPUTS=".:${HOME}/tex/lib/bibs"
