= Files =

The directory contains the bib resources of the KWARC group, most notably the
citation database kwarc.bib.  Note that kwarc.bib is generated by concatenating
the following individual files, and that it is read-only.  Please edit the
following files: 

* preamble.bib – LaTeX preamble that defines shared macros and strings
* kwarcpubs.bib – individual publications of KWARC members (e.g. @article,
  @inproceedings)
* kwarccrossrefs.bib – crossref targets (e.g. @proceedings) edited by KWARC
  members (e.g. when one of us chaired a workshop)
* extpubs.bib – publications by external researchers (which may cross-reference
  targets in kwarccrossrefs.bib!)
* extcrossrefs.bib – crossref targets edited by external researchers,
  regardless of whether KWARC or external publications refer to them.

For making citations in your documents, you can simply continue to use the
all-in-one kwarc.bib (but keep in mind that it is not editable!), or
alternatively you can use the individual files.  In the latter case, use the
following order:
1. preamble.bib
2. *pubs.bib
3. *crossrefs.bib

= Citation styles for URLs =

BibLaTeX is the most reliable way of citing URLs; see the how-to at
http://trac.kwarc.info/KWARC/wiki/BibLaTeX

There are also various unsupported legacy bst (bibTeX style files), most
notably the ones for for hyperrefed citations in alpha.bst. More can be
generated by editing the makefile.

At the moment we have alphahurl.bst 

To make use of these add something like the following to your environment
variables. 

# BibTeX
export BIBINPUTS=".:${HOME}/kwarc/doc/bibs"
export BSTINPUTS=".:${HOME}/tex/lib/bibs"
