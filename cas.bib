abstract="{Analytica is an automatic theorem prover for theorems in elementary
    analysis. The prover is written in the Mathematica language and
    runs in the Mathematica environment. The goal of the project
    is to use a powerful symbolic computation system to prove theorems
    that are beyond the scope of previous automatic theorem provers.
    The theorem prover is also able to deduce the correctness of
    certain simplification steps that would otherwise not be performed.
    We describe the structure of Analytica and explain the main techniques
    that it uses to construct proofs. Analytica has been able to
    prove several nontrivial theorems. In this paper, we show how
    it can prove a series of lemmas that lead to the Bernstein approximation
    theorem.}",

abstract="{We contrast theorem provers and computer algebra systems, pointing
    out the advantages and disadvantages of each, and suggest a simple
    way to achieve a synthesis of some of the best features of both.
    Our method is based on the systematic separation of search for
    a solution and checking the solution, using a physical connection
    between systems. We describe the separation of proof search and
    checking in some detail, relating it to proof planning and to
    the complexity class NP, and discuss different ways of exploiting
    a physical link between systems. Finally, the method is illustrated
    by some concrete examples of computer algebra results proved
    formally in the HOL theorem prover with the aid of Maple.}",
