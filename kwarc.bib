Traditional teaching materials (slides, handouts, annotated course material, assignments, and so on) are to be converted into a new hypermedia format, integrated with tool interactions for formally
developing correct software; they will be suitable for learning on campus and distance learning, as well as interactive, supervised, or co-operative self-study.
To ensure ``sustainable development'', i.e. continuous long-term usability of the contents, coherence and consistency are especially emphasised, through extensive semantic linking of teaching elements
and a particular version and configuration management, based on experience in formal software development  and associated support tools.},

	(deductive) database updates. The key idea is to tranform the given
	database together with the update request into a disjunctive logic
	program and apply disjunctive techniques (such as minimal model reasoning)
	to solve the original update problem. We present two variants of
	our algorithm both of which are of polynomial space complexity. One
	variant, which is based on offline preprocessing, is of polynomial
	time complexity. We also show that both variants are rational in
	the sense that they satisfy certain rationality postulates stemming

  abstract = {Formal calculi of record structures have recently been a focus of
	active research. However, scarcely anyone has studied formally the
	dual notion---i.e., argument-passing to functions by keywords, and
	its harmonization with currying. Recently, we introduced the label-selective
	$\lambda$-calculus, a conservative extension of $\lambda$-calculus
	that uses a labeling of abstractions and applications to perform
	unordered currying. In other words, it enables some form of commutation
	between arguments. This improves program legibility, thanks to the
	presence of labels, and efficiency, thanks to argument commuting.
	In this paper, we propose a simply typed version of the calculus,
	then extend it to one with ML-like polymorphic types. For the latter
	calculus, we establish the existence of principal types and we give
	an algorithm to compute them. Thanks to the fact that label-selective
	$\lambda$-calculus is a conservative extension of $\lambda$-calculus
	by adding numeric labels to stand for argument positions, its polymorphic
	typing provides us with a keyword argument-passing extension of ML
	obviating the need of records. In this context, conventional ML syntax
	can be seen as a restriction of the more general keyword-oriented
	syntax limited to using only implicit positions instead of keywords.},

While the annotation mode of CREAM allows creation of metadata for existing Web pages, the authoring mode lets authors create metadata--almost for free--while putting together the content of a page.As a feature of our framework, CREAM allows creating relational metadata, i.e., metadata that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively rigid template-like schema such as Dublin Core. We discuss some of the requirements one has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework, e.g., the integration of a metadata crawler, inference services, document management and a meta-ontology, and describe its implementation, viz. OntoMat, a component-based, ontology-driven Web-page authoring and annotation tool.},

  abstract = {Research on automated and interactive theorem proving aims at the
	mechanization of logical reasoning. Aside from the development of
	logic calculi it became rapidly apparent that the organization of
	proof search on top of the calculi is an essential task in the design
	of powerful theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how to
	organize proof search have emerged in that area of research, the
	most prominent representatives are generally described by the buzzwords:
	automated theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof planning.
	Despite their paradigmatic differences, all approaches share a common
	goal: to find a proof for a given conjecture. In this paper we start
	with a rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms in the area
	of proof planning and tactical theorem proving. Guided by similarities
	between software engineering and proof construction we develop a
	uniform view that accommodates the various proof search methodologies
	and eases their comparison. Based on this view, we propose a unified
	framework that enables the combination of different methodologies
	for proof construction to take advantage of their individual virtues
	within specific phases of a proof construction.}

  abstract = {The paper describes a lifted version FDPLL of the well-known Davis-Putnam-Logeman-Loveland
	(DPLL) procedure. While DPLL is based on a splitting rule for case
	analysis wrt.\ {\em ground\/} and complementary literals, FDPLL uses
	a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\ the case analysis is made wrt.\ non-ground
	and complementary literals now. \par The motivation for this lifting
	is the same as in all successful proof procedures for first-order
	logic used today: to gain efficiency by representing infinitely many
	inferences on the ground level in a compact way by means of computation
	with most general unifiers, and, to enable much more powerful redundancy
	tests as is possible when working on the ground level only. \par
	The main difficulty was to define a reading of the literals used
	for splitting that enables a sound, proof confluent and strongly
	complete calculus. It leads to a new technique to represent first-order
	interpretations. Based on it, the calculus and a respective proof
	procedure are developed. Special instances of FDPLL are propositional
	DPLL (for propositional clause logic) and unit-resulting resolution
	(for Horn clause logic). \par As the main result, strong completeness
	of the calculus and correctness of the proof procedure is proven.
	The method is prototypically implemented and was tested against the
	TPTP problem library.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on equality and extensionality in automated higher-order
	theorem proving based on Church's simply typed lambda-calculus (classical
	type theory). First, a landscape of various semantical notions is
	presented that is motivated by the different roles equality adopts
	in them. Each of the semantical notions in this landscape --- including
	Henkin semantics --- is then linked with an abstract consistency
	principle that can be employed for analysing the connection between
	syntax and semantics of higher-order calculi. Apart from this proof
	theoretic tools, the main contributions of this thesis are the three
	new calculi ER (extensional higher-order resolution), EP (extensional
	higher-order paramodulation) and ERUE (extensional higher-order RUE-resolution)
	which improve the mechanisation of defined and primitive equality
	in classical type theory. In contrast to the refutation approaches
	for classical type theory developed so far, these calculi reach Henkin
	completeness without requiring additional extensionality axioms.
	The key idea is to allow for recursive calls from higher-order unification
	to the overall refutation search. Calculus ER, which in contrast
	to EP and ERUE, considers equality only as a defined notion, has
	been implemented in the theorem prover LEO and the suitability of
	this approach for proving simple theorems about sets has been demonstrated
	in a case study.},

	applications often requires the help of mediator systems as middleware
	components. In the domain of theorem proving large efforts have been
	made to formalize knowledge for mathematics and verification issues,
	and to structure it in databases. But these databases are either
	specialized for a single client, or if the knowledge is stored in
	a general database, the services this database can provide are usually
	limited and hard to adjust for a particular theorem prover. Only
	recently there have been initiatives to flexibly connect existing
	theorem proving systems into networked environments that contain
	large knowledge bases. An intermediate layer containing both, search
	and proving functionality can be used to mediate between the two.
	In this paper we motivate the need and discuss the requirements for
	mediators between mathematical knowledge bases and theorem proving
	systems. We also present an attempt at a concurrent mediator between
	a knowledge base and a proof planning system.},

	the proof, and communicates these suggestions to the user via a graphical

	The planning operators, called methods, encode proving steps. One
	of the strength of proof planning comes from the usage of mathematical
	knowledge that heuristically restricts the search space. Semantically
	guided proof planning uses semantic information as search control
	heuristics. In this report we describe the realisation of semantically
	guided proof planning in the framework of the Omega system. We realised
	a module that answers queries from Multi, a multi-strategy proof
	planner of Omega, whether a concrete method application is suitable
	with respect to the semantic information as well as how promising
	the method application is. Provided with this information Multi rejects
	unsuitable method applications and prefers the most promising ones.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology for coupling several saturation-based theorem
	provers (running on different computers). The methodology is well-suited
	for realizing cooperation between different incarnations of one basic
	prover. Moreover, also different heterogeneous provers --that differ
	from each other in the calculus and in the heuristic they employ--
	can be coupled. Cooperation between the different provers is achieved
	by periodically interchanging clauses which are selected by so-called
	referees. We present theoretic results regarding the completeness
	of the system of cooperating provers as well as describe concrete
	heuristics for designing referees. Furthermore, we report on two
	experimental studies performed with homogeneous and heterogeneous
	provers in the areas superposition and unfailing completion. The
	results reveal that the occurring synergetic effects lead to a significant
	improvement of performance},

	turn in natural language analysis and in logic, the account for the
	dynamics of anaphoric context shifts in reasoning, is taken up along
	new lines. A standard way to treat reasoning with dynamic anaphora
	logics is by means of translation to first order predicate logic.
	This paper gives direct sequent axiomatisations of some well known
	dynamic anaphora logics. The calculi are shown to be sound and complete.
	The calculi throw new light on the relation between various formats
	for representing anaphoric links by means of sharing of dynamically
	bound variables. The sequent approach to the dynamics of anaphoric
	context takes the notion of anaphoric context change from premiss
	to conclusion as starting point of the analysis, and does not rely
	on an implicit translation to first order predicate logic.},

	an inference rule called ``condensed detachment'' are widely acknowledged
	as prominent test sets for automated deduction systems and their
	search guiding heuristics. It is in the light of these problems that
	we demonstrate the power of heuristics that make use of past proof
	experience with numerous experiments.\\ We present two such heuristics.
	The first heuristic attempts to re-enact a proof of a proof problem
	found in the past in a flexible way in order to find a proof of a
	similar problem. The second heuristic employs ``features'' in connection
	with past proof experience to prune the search space. Both these
	heuristics not only allow for substantial speed-ups, but also make
	it possible to prove problems that were out of reach when using so-called
	basic heuristics. Moreover, a combination of these two heuristics
	can further increase performance.\\ We compare our results with the
	results the creators of OTTER obtained with this renowned theorem
	prover and this way substantiate our achievements.},

	a popular tool for constructing the semantic representation of natural

	approach: it over-generates that is, it produces solutions which
	although they are mathematically valid, are linguistically incorrect
	because they do not represent possible meanings of the expression
	being analysed. In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Colored
	Unification ({\hocu}) can help prevent over-generation and we describe
	the linguistic, logical and computational aspects of an {\hocu}--based

	Our method is based on the systematic separation of search for a
	solution and checking the solution, using a physical connection between
	systems. We describe the separation of proof search and checking
	in some detail, relating it to proof planning and to the complexity
	class NP, and discuss different ways of exploiting a physical link
	between systems. Finally, the method is illustrated by some concrete
	examples of computer algebra results proved formally in the HOL theorem
	prover with the aid of Maple.}}

	Kleene has already given a semantic account of partial functions

	satisfactory mechanization. Recent years have seen a thorough investigation
	of the framework of many-valued truth-functional logics. However,
	strong Kleene logic, where quantification is restricted and therefore
	not truth-functional, does not fit the framework directly. We solve
	this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics. This

	of partial functions with the efficiency of sorted calculi.}

  abstract = { Mechanised reasoning systems and computer algebra systems have different
	objectives. Their integration is highly desirable, since formal proofs
	often involve both of the two different tasks, proving and calculating.
	Even more importantly, proof and computation are often interwoven
	and not easily separable. In this contribution we advocate an integration
	of computer algebra into mechanised reasoning systems at the proof
	plan level. This approach allows to view the computer algebra algorithms
	as {\em methods}, that is, declarative representations of the problem
	solving knowledge specific to a certain mathematical domain. Automation
	can be achieved in many cases by searching for a hierarchic {\em
	proof plan\/} at the method-level using suitable domain-specific
	control knowledge about the mathematical algorithms. In other words,
	the uniform framework of proof planning allows to solve a large class
	of problems that are not automatically solvable by separate systems.
	Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness problems inherent
	in such an integration. We advocate an approach where the computer
	algebra system produces high-level protocol information that can
	be processed by an interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof
	plan in turn can be expanded to proofs at different levels of abstraction,
	so the approach is well-suited for producing a high-level verbalised
	explication as well as for a low-level machine checkable calculus-level
	proof. We present an implementation of our ideas and exemplify them
	using an automatically solved example.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a multi-valued variant of higher-order resolution
	and proves it correct and complete with respect to a variant of Henkin's
	general model semantics. This resolution method is parametric in
	the number of truth values as well as in the particular choice of
	the set of connectives (given by arbitrary truth tables) and even
	substitutional quantifiers. In the course of the completeness proof
	we establish a model existence theorem for this logical system. The
	work reported in this paper provides a basis for developing higher-order
	mechanizations for many non-classical logics.},

  abstract = {Proof planning is the application of Artificial Intelligence planning
	techniques to prove mathematical theorems. While exploring the domain
	of the residue classes over the integers with the multi-strategy
	proof planner MULTI we found a class of hard problems on which proof
	planning showed a remarkable high degree of variance. On problems
	of the same complexity we either succeeded very quickly with short
	proofs or the proof planning process took significantly longer and
	resulted in a large proof. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence
	points out that the unpredictability in the running time of heuristic
	search procedures can often be explained by the phenomenon of heavy-tailed
	cost distributions. Because of the non-standard nature of these heavy-tailed
	cost distributions the controled introduction of randomization into
	the search procedures and quick restarts of the randomized procedure
	can eliminate heavy-tailed behavior and can take advantage of short
	runs. In this report, we describe experiments and analyze the results
	that demonstrate that the observed high variance and the unpredictability
	in performance of proof planning with MULTI can be explained by underlying
	heavy-tailed cost distributions. Moreover, we explain how based on
	these results the application of randomization and restart techniques
	can boost the proof planning process and increase the solvability
	horizon of proof planning. Finally, we present how randomization
	and restarts are realized technically in the MULTI system.},

	in frames and control-rules, constraint solving, tactical and meta-level
	reasoning. It differs from traditional search-based techniques in
	ATP not least with respect to its level of abstraction: the proof
	of a theorem is planned at an abstract level and an outline of the
	proof is found. This outline, i.e. the abstract proof plan, can be
	recursively expanded and it will thus construct a proof within a
	logical calculus. The plan operators represent mathematical techniques
	familiar to a working mathematician. While the knowledge of a domain
	is specific to the mathematical field, the representational techniques
	and reasoning procedures are general-purpose. The general-purpose
	planner makes use of this mathematical domain knowledge and of the
	guidance provided by declaratively represented control-rules which
	correspond to mathematical intuition about how to prove a theorem
	in a particular situation. These rules provide a basis for meta-level
	reasoning and goal-directed behaviour. We demonstrate our approach
	for the mathematical domain of limit theorems, which was proposed
	as a challenge to automated theorem proving by the late Woody Bledsoe.
	Using the proof planner of the \OMEGA\ system we were able to solve
	all the well known challenge theorems including those that cannot
	be solved by any of the existing traditional systems.}

	in a formal program development in order to ease the management of
	change and reusing proofs. In this work, we extend development graphs
	with hiding (e.g. hidden operations). Hiding is a particularly difficult
	to realize operation, since it does not admit such a good decomposition
	of the involved specifications as other structuring operations do.
	We develop both a semantics and proof rules for development graphs
	with hiding. The rules are proven to be sound, and also complete
	relative to an oracle for conservative extensions. We also show that
	an absolutely complete set of rules cannot exist.
	
	 The whole framework is developed in a way independent of the underlying
	logical system (and thus also does not prescribe the nature of the
	parts of a specification that may be hidden). We also show how various
	other logic independent specification formalisms can be mapped into
	development graphs; thus, development graphs can serve as a kernel
	formalism for management of proofs and of change.},

  abstract = {An extension of tableaux is presented. The extension is threefold:
	a new rule allowing the use of information deduced during the building
	of the tableau in order to {\em simplify formulae occurring in it},
	integration of {\em semantic strategies} (i.e. strategies based on
	the use of interpretations) that prune the search space and a new
	way of {\em extracting a model} from a given (possibly infinite)
	branch. These features are combined with a former method for simultaneous
	search for refutations and models. The capabilities of the new method
	w.r.t. the original one are clearly stated. A non-trivial extension
	of the standard proof using Hintikka sets is introduced in order
	to prove the refutational completeness of our method.
	
	Finally, it is shown that the method is able to build models for any
	formula having a model that can be specified by equational constraints.
	This class contains many existing decidable classes of formulae such
	as the Bernays--Sch\"{o}nfinkel class \cite{DG79,BGG97}, the {\sc
	Pvd} and {\sc Occ1N} classes \cite{FLTZ93} etc.},

	auf Erfahrungen zur\"uck, die er mit der Analyse der th\"uringischen
	Lehrplanentwicklung im Fach "Sozialkunde" gemacht hat. Zugleich sollen
	Anschlussm\"oglichkeiten an \"Uberlegungen der Politikdidaktik zumindest
	kursorisch aufgezeigt werden. Als Voraussetzung daf\"ur wird der

	we have designed a web-based framework for dynamically producing

	design relies on the separation of knowledge representation from
	system functionalities. Salient features of our system are the individual
	generation of interactive documents based on general domain knowledge,
	user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge as well as the
	integration of external problem solving systems. The paper describes
	the distributed web-based architecture of our system and the principles

	records, including a record concatenation operator, is decidable.
	We show that this calculus does not have principal types, but does
	have finite complete sets of types: that is, for any term $M$ in
	the calculus, there exists an effectively generable finite set of
	type schemes such that every typing for $M$ is an instance of one
	the schemes in the set.
	
	We show how a simple model of object-oriented programming, including
	hidden instance variables and multiple inheritance, may be coded
	in this calculus. We conclude that type inference is decidable for
	object-oriented programs, even with multiple inheritance and classes
	as first-class values.},

	emerging architectures for distributed mathematical problem solving:
	the MathWeb\ Software Bus (MathWeb-SB) and the Logic Broker Architecture
	(LBA). The bridge between MathWeb-SB and LBA is achieved by a common
	interface based on KQML and OpenMath. We augmented both architectures
	with MathWeb agents that communicate via a common interface sending
	KQML messages. The proposed interface offers an appropriate abstraction
	for combining architectures like the MathWeb-SB and the LBA and allows
	external systems to easily access the mathematical services of both
	architectures. As a case study we show that MathWeb\ agents encapsulating
	the RDL system, the mathematical knowledge base MBase and the Omega
	system --- sited in the LBA or in the MathWeb-SB respectively ---
	can communicate via our bridge and perform cooperative problem solving.}

  abstract = {Over the past thirty years there have been significant achievements
	in the field of automated theorem proving with respect to the reasoning
	power of the inference engines. Although some effort has also been
	spent to facilitate more user friendliness of the deduction systems,
	most of them failed to benefit from more recent developments in the
	related fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as natural language
	generation and user modeling. In particular, no model is available
	which accounts both for human deductive activities {\em and\/} for
	human proof presentation. In this thesis, a reconstructive architecture
	is suggested which substantially abstracts, reorganizes and finally
	translates machine-found proofs into natural language. Both the procedures
	and the intermediate representations of our architecture find their
	basis in computational models for {\em informal mathematical reasoning\/}
	and for {\em proof presentation\/}.}
