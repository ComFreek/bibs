LaTeX-based generation of publications files for the KWARC group. 

This directory contains an infrastructure for managing the generation of publication 
lists in LaTeX (e.g. for CVs or research reports). 

The core of this infrastructure is the biTeX file ../kwarc.bib together with  a set of files
<name>.tex, which contain instructions of the form \nocite{xxx,yyy,zzz}, where xxx, 
yyy, and zzz are references into ../kwarc.bib. If included into a LaTeX document via the 
\input command, these instructions will make sure that bibliographic references are 
generated for them in the PDF output. 

There is one file <name>.tex per category, year, and author/group (the files kwarc.tex 
are for the whole KWARC group. Group files tend to include author files via \inpath 
macro (a custom variant of \input that gets the paths right; see the files all.tex for its 
definition). 

The authro/group files are organized via the file system infrastructure. 
The first-level directories are the categories:
editions:		edited books without proceedings, mostly special journal issues
standards:  	and related documents
workshops: 	contributions to workshops (mostly peer reviewd, but no archival proceedings)
books: 		books written, but not edited. 
incollections: 	articles in collections
proceedings: 	edited proceedings
techreports: 	technical reports
articles: 		articles in journals
conferences: 	articles in peer-reviewd conferences with archival proceedings
software: 	software and related documents
theses: 		B.Sc, M.Sc, and Ph.D. thesis in the KWARC group.

These contain subdirectories for the years, and these in turn the author/group files. 

The the top-level and category directories contain author/group files that collect the 
various author/group files from all the years.  Also they contain files all.tex, which 
can be run through LaTeX for generating the lists.  

Finally all directories contain Makefiles, so that the PDFs can be generated by a simple
make all.  

To add yourself as an author, add your publications to ../kwarc.bib (do not forget the 
pubs={...} entries for the web generation) and 
 - for all of them add a file <name>.tex that contains \nocite instructions for all the 
    publications of that category and year. 
 - add \inpath{<cat>}{<year>}{<name>} to the file kwarc.tex

Note that some of your \nocites may already be in kwarc.tex the first time you do this.
