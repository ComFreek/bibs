  abstract = "We show that the type inference problem for a lambda
calculus with records, including a record concatenation operator, is
decidable.  We show that this calculus does not have principal types,
but does have finite complete sets of types: that is, for any term $M$
in the calculus, there exists an effectively generable finite set of
type schemes such that every typing for $M$ is an instance of one the
schemes in the set.

We show how a simple model of object-oriented programming, including hidden
instance variables and multiple inheritance, may be coded in this calculus.
We conclude that type inference is decidable for object-oriented programs,
even with multiple inheritance and classes as first-class values."

    ABSTRACT = {Formal calculi of record structures have recently been
a focus of active research. However, scarcely anyone has studied
formally the dual notion---i.e., argument-passing to functions by
keywords, and its harmonization with currying.  Recently, we
introduced the label-selective $\lambda$-calculus, a conservative
extension of $\lambda$-calculus that uses a labeling of abstractions
and applications to perform unordered currying. In other words, it
enables some form of commutation between arguments. This improves
program legibility, thanks to the presence of labels, and
efficiency, thanks to argument commuting.  In this paper, we propose
a simply typed version of the calculus, then extend it to one with
ML-like polymorphic types. For the latter calculus, we establish the
existence of principal types and we give an algorithm to compute
them.  Thanks to the fact that label-selective $\lambda$-calculus is
a conservative extension of $\lambda$-calculus by adding numeric
labels to stand for argument positions, its polymorphic typing
provides us with a keyword argument-passing extension of ML
obviating the need of records.  In this context, conventional ML
syntax can be seen as a restriction of the more general
keyword-oriented syntax limited to using only implicit positions
instead of keywords.}
