  abstract = {Today's interactive mathematics textbooks use a collection of predefined documents,
  typically organized as a network of html pages. This makes a reuse and a sound
  re-combination of the encoded knowledge impossible and inhibits a radical adaption of
  course presentation and content to the user's needs.  In order to avoid these drawbacks
  we have designed a web-based framework for dynamically producing interactive documents
  for learning mathematics called ID.  The system design relies on the separation of
  knowledge representation from system functionalities.  Salient features of our system
  are the individual generation of interactive documents based on general domain
  knowledge, user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge as well as the integration
  of external problem solving systems.  The paper describes the distributed web-based
  architecture of our system and the principles of its components.}
