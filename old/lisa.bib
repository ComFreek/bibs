   ABSTRACT  = {The semantics of everyday language and the semantics of its naive
  translation into classical first-order language considerably
  differ. An important discrepancy that is addressed in this paper is
  about the implicit assumption what exists.  For instance, in the
  case of universal quantification natural language uses restrictions
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language. These problems have
  been discussed in philosophical logic and some adequate many-valued
  logics were developed to model these phenomena much better than
  classical first-order logic can do. An adequate calculus, however,
  has not yet been given.  Recent years have seen a thorough
  investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional
  logics.  Unfortunately, restricted quantifications are not
  truth-functional, hence they do not fit the framework directly.  We
  solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.}}

  abstract    = {It is well-known that many relevant aspects of everyday reasoning
  based on natural language cannot be adequately expressed in
  classical first-order logic.  In this paper we address two of the
  problems, firstly that of so-called presuppositions,
  expressions from which it is possible to draw implicit conclusion,
  which classical logic normally does not warrant, and secondly the
  related problem of partiality and the adequate treatment of
  undefined expressions.  In natural language, presuppositions are
  quite common, they can, however, only insufficiently be modeled in
  classical first-order logic.  For instance, in the case of universal
  quantification one normally uses restrictions in natural language
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language.  Similarly,
  undefined expressions can be handled in natural language discourses
  and utterances are not only classified into the two categories
  `true' and `false'.  This has led to the development of various
  better-suited many-valued logics.
  
  By combining different approaches we can now give a static description of
  presuppositions and undefinedness within the same framework. Additionally, we
  have developed an efficient mechanization of the induced consequence relation (which
  has been missing in the literature) by combining methods from many-valued
  truth-functional logics and sort techniques developed for search control in
  automated theorem proving.}
