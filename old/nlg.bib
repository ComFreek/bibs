abstract  = {Over the past thirty years there have been significant achievements in
the field of automated theorem proving with respect to the reasoning
power of the inference engines.  Although some effort has also been
spent to facilitate more user friendliness of the deduction systems,
most of them failed to benefit from more recent developments in the
related fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as natural
language generation and user modeling. In particular, no model is
available which accounts both for human deductive activities {\em
  and\/} for human proof presentation.  In this thesis, a
reconstructive architecture is suggested which substantially
abstracts, reorganizes and finally translates machine-found proofs
into natural language. Both the procedures and the intermediate
representations of our architecture find their basis in computational
models for {\em informal mathematical reasoning\/} and for {\em proof
  presentation\/}.}
