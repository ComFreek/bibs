ABSTRACT = {Tableaux and the free variable tableaux are extended
with sorts. Sorts are sets of unary predicates.
They can be attached to variables. Semantically, the domain of a
variable is restricted to the intersection of the denotations of the attached predicates.
Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified $\gamma$ and $\delta$
rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableaux
is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableaux
with sorts and free variable tableaux with sorts are proved sound, complete and more
suitable for mechanization than their counterparts without sorts.},
