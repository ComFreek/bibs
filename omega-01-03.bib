  abstract =	 {Research on automated and interactive theorem proving aims at the
                  mechanization of logical reasoning. Aside from the development of logic
                  calculi it became rapidly apparent that the organization of proof search
                  on top of the calculi is an essential task in the design of powerful
                  theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how to organize proof
                  search have emerged in that area of research, the most prominent
                  representatives are generally described by the buzzwords: automated
                  theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof planning. Despite
                  their paradigmatic differences, all approaches share a common goal: to
                  find a proof for a given conjecture. In this paper we start with a
                  rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms in the area of proof
                  planning and tactical theorem proving. Guided by similarities between
                  software engineering and proof construction we develop a uniform view
                  that accommodates the various proof search methodologies and eases their
                  comparison. Based on this view, we propose a unified framework that
                  enables the combination of different methodologies for proof
                  construction to take advantage of their individual virtues within
                  specific phases of a proof construction.},

  abstract    = {Proof planning is an application of AI-planning in
                 mathematical domains. The planning operators, called
                 methods, encode proving steps. One of the strength of
                 proof planning comes from the usage of mathematical
                 knowledge that heuristically restricts the search space.
                 Semantically guided proof planning uses semantic
                 information as search control heuristics. In this report
                 we describe the realisation of semantically guided proof
                 planning in the framework of the Omega system. We realised
                 a module that answers queries from Multi, a multi-strategy
                 proof planner of Omega, whether a concrete method
                 application is suitable with respect to the semantic
                 information as well as how promising the method
                 application is. Provided with this information Multi
                 rejects unsuitable method applications and prefers the
                 most promising ones.

                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of
                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. This is
                  work in progress, and we hope to gain useful feedback from the workshop

  emerging architectures for distributed mathematical problem solving: the
  MathWeb\ Software Bus (MathWeb-SB) and the Logic Broker Architecture
  (LBA). The bridge between MathWeb-SB and LBA is achieved by a common
  interface based on KQML and OpenMath.  We augmented both architectures
  with MathWeb agents that communicate via a common interface sending
  KQML messages. The proposed interface offers an appropriate abstraction
  for combining architectures like the MathWeb-SB and the LBA and allows
  external systems to easily access the mathematical services of both
  architectures.  As a case study we show that MathWeb\ agents encapsulating
  the RDL system, the mathematical knowledge base MBase and the Omega
  system --- sited in the LBA or in the MathWeb-SB respectively --- can
  communicate via our bridge and perform cooperative problem solving.}

   under review by the Journal of Symbolic Logic and develops the cut-free
   extensions in detail.},

illustrate the parallels and

We discuss the appropriateness of these types of calculi for this integration.

raising, explicit variable dependency representation,
the liberalized delta-rule, and preservation of solutions.}}

abstract =     {Accessing knowledge of a single knowledge source with different client
applications often requires the help of mediator systems as middleware
components. In the domain of theorem proving large efforts have been
made to formalize knowledge for mathematics and verification issues, and
to structure it in databases. But these databases are either specialized
for a single client, or if the knowledge is stored in a general
database, the services this database can provide are usually limited and
hard to adjust for a particular theorem prover. Only recently there have
been initiatives to flexibly connect existing theorem proving systems
into networked environments that contain large knowledge bases. An
intermediate layer containing both, search and proving functionality can
be used to mediate between the two. In this paper we motivate the need
and discuss the requirements for mediators between mathematical
knowledge bases and theorem proving systems. We also present an attempt
at a concurrent mediator between a knowledge base and a proof planning
system.}

logic with the purpose of clarifying the role of
extensionality. To
reach this goal, we distinguish nine classes of higher order
models with
respect to various combinations of Boolean extensionality and
three
forms of functional extensionality. Furthermore, we develop a
methodology of abstract consistency methods (by providing the
necessary
model existence theorems) needed to analyze completeness of
(machine-oriented) higher order calculi with respect to these
model
classes.},

journal   ={96 pp., accepted by Logic Journal of the IGPL},

publisher ={Oxford University Press},
note      ={{\url{www.ags.uni-sb.de/~cp/p/d/welcome.html}}},
abstract  ={Inductive theorem proving in the form of descente infinie was
known to the ancient Greeks and is the standard induction method of a working
mathematician since it was reinvented in the middle of the 17th century.
We present an integration of descente infinie into state-of-the-art
free-variable sequent and tableau calculi.
It is well-suited for an efficient interplay of human interaction and
automation and combines raising, explicit representation of variable
dependency,
the liberalized delta-rule, preservation of solutions,
and unrestricted applicability of lemmas and induction hypotheses.
The semantical requirements are satisfied for a variety of two-valued logics,
such as clausal logic, classical first-order logic,
and higher-order modal logic.}}
