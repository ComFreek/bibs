decreasing the necessary

steadily computes suggestions on how

equivalence of distinct definitions for

where various axiomatizations

equivalent definitions are canonical in
                  major simplification steps. Starting out with a proof for the
equivalence of two distinct

objectives. Their integration is highly desirable, since formal proofs often involve both
of the two different tasks, proving and calculating. Even more importantly, proof and
computation are often interwoven and not easily separable. In this contribution we
advocate an integration of computer algebra into mechanised reasoning systems at the proof
plan level. This approach allows to view the computer algebra algorithms as {\em methods},
that is, declarative representations of the problem solving knowledge specific to a
certain mathematical domain. Automation can be achieved in many cases by searching for a
hierarchic {\em proof plan\/} at the method-level using suitable domain-specific control
knowledge about the mathematical algorithms. In other words, the uniform framework of
proof planning allows to solve a large class of problems that are not automatically
solvable by separate systems. Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness
problems inherent in such an integration. We advocate an approach where the computer
algebra system produces high-level protocol information that can be processed by an
interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in turn can be expanded to proofs at
different levels of abstraction, so the approach is well-suited for producing a high-level
verbalised explication as well as for a low-level machine checkable calculus-level
proof. We present an implementation of our ideas and exemplify them using an automatically
solved example.}  }

this {\it genuinely} mathematical problem. Our goal here was to use a {\it source} proof
plan of HB1 (the Heine-Borel theorem in R$^1$) as a guide to automatically produce a proof
plan of HB2 (the Heine-Borel theorem in R$^2$). We were able to accomplish our goal by
generating the {\it target} proof plan of HB2 by reformulation and analogical replay. } }

  ABSTRACT =  {This paper focuses on equality and extensionality in automated
higher-order theorem proving
                  based on Church's simply typed lambda-calculus (classical
type theory). First, a landscape
                  of various semantical notions is presented that is motivated
by the different roles equality
                  adopts in them. Each of the semantical notions in this
landscape --- including Henkin
                  semantics --- is then linked with an abstract consistency
principle that can be employed for
                  analysing the connection between syntax and semantics of
higher-order calculi. Apart from
                  this proof theoretic tools, the main contributions of this
thesis are the three new calculi
                  ER (extensional higher-order resolution), EP (extensional
higher-order paramodulation) and
                  ERUE (extensional higher-order RUE-resolution) which improve
the mechanisation of defined
                  and primitive equality in classical type theory. In contrast
to the refutation approaches
                  for classical type theory developed so far, these calculi
reach Henkin completeness without
                  requiring additional extensionality axioms. The key idea is
to allow for recursive calls
                  from higher-order unification to the overall refutation
search. Calculus ER, which in
                  contrast to EP and ERUE, considers equality only as a defined
notion, has been implemented
                  in the theorem prover LEO and the suitability of this
approach for proving simple theorems
                  about sets has been demonstrated in a case study.}

mathematical domains, the
                  presentation must be adapted to the knowledge of the intended
audience. Current proof
                  presentation systems only communicate proofs on a fixed
degree of abstraction independently
                  of the addressee's knowledge. In this paper we propose an
architecture for an interactive
                  proof explanation system, called P.rex. Based on the theory
of human cognition ACT-R, its
                  dialog planner exploits a cognitive model, in which both the
user's knowledge and his
                  cognitive processes are modeled. By this means, his cognitive
states are traced during the
                  explanation. The explicit representation of the user's
cognitive states in ACT-R allows the
                  dialog planner to choose a degree of abstraction tailored to
the user for each proof step to

  abstract =  { It is well-known that many relevant aspects of everyday
reasoning based on natural language
                  cannot be adequately expressed in classical first-order
logic. In this paper we address two
                  of the problems, firstly that of so-called {\em
presuppositions\/}, expressions from which
                  it is possible to draw implicit conclusion, which classical
logic normally does not warrant,
                  and secondly the related problem of {\em partiality\/} and
the adequate treatment of
                  undefined expressions. In natural language, presuppositions
are quite common, they can,
                  however, only insufficiently be modeled in classical
first-order logic. For instance, in the
                  case of universal quantification one normally uses
restrictions in natural language and
                  presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
classical logic it is only
                  assumed that the whole universe is non-empty. On the other
hand, all constants mentioned in
                  classical logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no
problems to speak about
                  hypothetical objects in everyday language. Similarly,
undefined expressions can be handled
                  in natural language discourses and utterances are not only
classified into the two
                  categories `true' and `false'. This has led to the
development of various better-suited
                  many-valued logics. By combining different approaches we can
now give a static description
                  of presuppositions and undefinedness within the same
framework. Additionally, we have
                  developed an efficient mechanization of the induced
consequence relation (which has been
                  missing in the literature) by combining methods from
many-valued truth-functional logics and
                  sort techniques developed for search control in automated
theorem proving.}

proving (ATP) which swings the motivational pendulum back to its AI-origins in that it
employs and further develops many AI-principles and techniques such as hierarchical
planning, knowledge representation in frames and control-rules, constraint solving,
tactical and meta-level reasoning. It differs from traditional search-based techniques in
ATP not least with respect to its level of abstraction: the proof of a theorem is planned
at an abstract level and an outline of the proof is found. This outline, i.e. the abstract
proof plan, can be recursively expanded and it will thus construct a proof within a
logical calculus. The plan operators represent mathematical techniques familiar to a
working mathematician. While the knowledge of a domain is specific to the mathematical
field, the representational techniques and reasoning procedures are general-purpose. The
general-purpose planner makes use of this mathematical domain knowledge and of the
guidance provided by declaratively represented control-rules which correspond to
mathematical intuition about how to prove a theorem in a particular situation. These rules
provide a basis for meta-level reasoning and goal-directed behaviour. We demonstrate our
approach for the mathematical domain of limit theorems, which was proposed as a challenge
to automated theorem proving by the late Woody Bledsoe. Using the proof planner of the
\OMEGA\ system we were able to solve all the well known challenge theorems including those
that cannot be solved by any of the existing traditional systems.}

Church's simply typed

extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin
completeness without the need for
                  additional extensionality axioms both calculi employ new,
positive extensionality rules
                  analogously to the respective negative ones provided by
$\EXTRES$ that operate on
                  unification constraints. As the extensionality rules have an
intrinsic and unavoidable
                  difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
looses its pure term-rewriting
                  character. On the other hand examples demonstrate that the
extensionality rules harmonise
                  rather well with the difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution
idea.}

different levels of

explicitness, abstraction and
                  presentation strategy. Then, we shall suggest an appropriate
architecture focusing on the

speech acts as the primitive
                  actions planned by the dialog planner and show how plan

planning techniques to prove

residue classes over the integers
                  with the multi-strategy proof planner MULTI we found a class
of hard problems on which proof
                  planning showed a remarkable high degree of variance. On
problems of the same complexity we
                  either succeeded very quickly with short proofs or the proof
planning process took
                  significantly longer and resulted in a large proof. Recent
work in Artificial Intelligence
                  points out that the unpredictability in the running time of
heuristic search procedures can
                  often be explained by the phenomenon of heavy-tailed cost
distributions. Because of the
                  non-standard nature of these heavy-tailed cost distributions
the controled introduction of
                  randomization into the search procedures and quick restarts
of the randomized procedure can
                  eliminate heavy-tailed behavior and can take advantage of
short runs. In this report, we
                  describe experiments and analyze the results that demonstrate
that the observed high
                  variance and the unpredictability in performance of proof
planning with MULTI can be
                  explained by underlying heavy-tailed cost distributions.
Moreover, we explain how based on
                  these results the application of randomization and restart
techniques can boost the proof
                  planning process and increase the solvability horizon of
proof planning. Finally, we present
                  how randomization and restarts are realized technically in
the MULTI system.}

into proof planning. It is
                  based on the idea to separate computation and verification
and can thereby exploit the fact
                  that many elaborate symbolic computations are trivially
checked. In proof planning the
                  separation is realized by using a powerful computer algebra
system during the planning
                  process to do non-trivial symbolic computations. Results of
these computations are checked
                  during the refinement of a proof plan to a calculus level
proof using a small,
                  self-implemented system that gives us protocol information on
its calculation. This protocol
                  can be easily expanded into a checkable low-level calculus
proof ensuring the correctness of
                  the computation. We demonstrate our approach with the
concrete implementation in the OMEGA
                  system.},

extended by an automated learning

of learning new proof methods
                  from well chosen examples of proofs which use a similar
reasoning strategy to prove related
                  theorems, and this strategy could be characterised as a proof
method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning
technique which can learn
                  methods using this representation framework. The technique
can be applied (amongst other) to
                  learn whether and when to call external systems such as
theorem provers or computer algebra
                  systems. This is work in progress, and we hope to gain useful
