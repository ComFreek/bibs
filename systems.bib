 ABSTRACT = {We present a methodology for coupling several saturation-based 
theorem provers (running on different computers).
The methodology is well-suited for realizing cooperation between
different incarnations of one basic prover. Moreover, also
different heterogeneous provers --that differ from each other 
in the calculus and in the heuristic they employ--
can be coupled.
Cooperation between the different provers is achieved by
periodically interchanging clauses which are selected by 
so-called referees.
We present theoretic results regarding the completeness of the 
system of cooperating provers as well as describe concrete 
heuristics for designing referees. Furthermore, we report on 
two experimental studies performed with
homogeneous and heterogeneous provers in the areas superposition 
and unfailing completion. The results reveal that the occurring 
synergetic effects lead to a significant improvement of 
performance},

 ABSTRACT = {HOT is an automated higher-order theorem prover based on HTE, an
  extensional higher-order tableaux calculus (Kohlhase 95). The first
  part of the paper introduces a variant of the calculus which closely
  corresponds to the proof procedure implemented in HOT. The second part
  discusses HOT's design that can be characterized as a concurrent Blackboard
  architecture.  We show the usefulness of the implementation by including
  benchmark results for over one hundred solved problems from logic and set
  theory.},
