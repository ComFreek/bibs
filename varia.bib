		  While DPLL is based on a splitting rule for case analysis

		  a lifted splitting rule, i.e.\ the case analysis is made
		  wrt.\ non-ground and complementary literals now. \par The
		  motivation for this lifting is the same as in all
		  successful proof procedures for first-order logic used
		  today: to gain efficiency by representing infinitely many
		  inferences on the ground level in a compact way by means of
		  computation with most general unifiers, and, to enable much
		  more powerful redundancy tests as is possible when working
		  on the ground level only. \par The main difficulty was to
		  define a reading of the literals used for splitting that
		  enables a sound, proof confluent and strongly complete
		  calculus. It leads to a new technique to represent
		  first-order interpretations. Based on it, the calculus and
		  a respective proof procedure are developed. Special
		  instances of FDPLL are propositional DPLL (for
		  propositional clause logic) and unit-resulting resolution
		  (for Horn clause logic). \par As the main result, strong
		  completeness of the calculus and correctness of the proof
		  procedure is proven. The method is prototypically
		  implemented and was tested against the TPTP problem
		  library.",

 ABSTRACT = {We present a concept for an automated theorem prover that
employs a search control based on ideas from several areas of
artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of case-based
reasoning, several similarity concepts, a cooperation concept of
distributed AI and reactive planning enables a system using our 
concept to learn form previous successful proof attempts. In a
kind of bootstrapping process easy problems are used to solve
more and more complicated ones.
We provide case studies from two domains of interest in pure
equational theorem proving taken from the TPTP library. These
case studies show that an instantiation of our architecture
achieves a high grade of automation and outperforms state-of-
the-art conventional theorem provers.},

 ABSTRACT = {Problems stemming from the study of logic calculi
in connection with an inference
rule called ``condensed detachment'' are widely acknowledged as
prominent test sets for automated deduction systems and their
search guiding heuristics. It is in the light of these problems that
we demonstrate the power of heuristics that make use of past proof
experience with numerous experiments.\\
We present two such heuristics. The first heuristic attempts to
re-enact a proof of a proof problem found in the past in a flexible
way in order to find a proof of a similar problem. The second
heuristic employs ``features'' in connection with past proof
experience to prune the search space.
Both these heuristics not only allow for substantial speed-ups,
but also make it possible to prove problems that were out of reach
when using so-called basic heuristics. Moreover, a combination
of these two heuristics can further increase performance.\\
We compare our results with the results the creators of OTTER
obtained with this renowned theorem prover and this way
substantiate our achievements.},

systems has
advanced markedly in the last decade.  In particular, various term
indexing techniques have been developed. Term indexing supports the
construction of efficient automated reasoning systems by providing
rapid access to first-order predicate calculus terms with specific
properties. The author addresses the advanced designer of automated
reasoning systems and assumes that the reader has detailed knowledge
of automated reasoning and logic.}}

   ABSTRACT  = {The semantics of everyday language and the semantics of its naive
  translation into classical first-order language considerably
  differ. An important discrepancy that is addressed in this paper is
  about the implicit assumption what exists.  For instance, in the
  case of universal quantification natural language uses restrictions
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language. These problems have
  been discussed in philosophical logic and some adequate many-valued
  logics were developed to model these phenomena much better than
  classical first-order logic can do. An adequate calculus, however,
  has not yet been given.  Recent years have seen a thorough
  investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional
  logics.  Unfortunately, restricted quantifications are not
  truth-functional, hence they do not fit the framework directly.  We
  solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.}}

   ABSTRACT  = {Even though it is not very often admitted, partial functions do play a
significant role in many practical applications of deduction
systems. Kleene has already given a semantic account of partial
functions using a three-valued logic decades ago, but there has not been
a satisfactory mechanization. Recent years have seen a thorough
investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional logics.
However, strong Kleene logic, where quantification is restricted and
therefore not truth-functional, does not fit the framework directly.
We solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.
This paper presents a tableau calculus that combines the proper
treatment of partial functions with the efficiency of sorted calculi.}}

  abstract    = {It is well-known that many relevant aspects of everyday reasoning
  based on natural language cannot be adequately expressed in
  classical first-order logic.  In this paper we address two of the
  problems, firstly that of so-called presuppositions,
  expressions from which it is possible to draw implicit conclusion,
  which classical logic normally does not warrant, and secondly the
  related problem of partiality and the adequate treatment of
  undefined expressions.  In natural language, presuppositions are
  quite common, they can, however, only insufficiently be modeled in
  classical first-order logic.  For instance, in the case of universal
  quantification one normally uses restrictions in natural language
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language.  Similarly,
  undefined expressions can be handled in natural language discourses
  and utterances are not only classified into the two categories
  `true' and `false'.  This has led to the development of various
  better-suited many-valued logics.
  
  By combining different approaches we can now give a static description of
  presuppositions and undefinedness within the same framework. Additionally, we
  have developed an efficient mechanization of the induced consequence relation (which
  has been missing in the literature) by combining methods from many-valued
  truth-functional logics and sort techniques developed for search control in
  automated theorem proving.}}

  abstract = {An extension of tableaux is presented.
The extension is threefold: a new rule allowing the use of information
deduced during the building of the tableau in order to {\em simplify formulae
occurring in it}, integration of {\em semantic strategies} (i.e. strategies
based on the use of interpretations) that prune the search space and a new
way of {\em extracting a model} from a given (possibly infinite) branch.
These features are combined with a former method for simultaneous search for
refutations and models.
The capabilities of the new method w.r.t. the original one are clearly
stated.
A non-trivial extension of the standard proof using Hintikka sets is
introduced in order to prove the refutational completeness of our method.

Finally, it is shown that the method is able to build models for any formula
having a model that can be specified by equational constraints. This class
contains many existing decidable classes of formulae such as the
Bernays--Sch\"{o}nfinkel class \cite{DG79,BGG97}, the {\sc Pvd} and {\sc
Occ1N} classes \cite{FLTZ93} etc.}}

TITLE = {SPASS \& FLOTTER, Version 0.42},
crossref  = {CADE96},
ABSTRACT = {FLOTTER and SPASS are a clause normal form translator for first-order
logic and a theorem prover for first-order logic with equality, respectively.
The algorithm implemented by FLOTTER includes an improved form of the renaming technique
developed by Thierry Boy de la Tour and the optimized
Skolemization technique by Ohlbach and Weidenbach. 
SPASS is based on the superposition
calculus developed by Bachmair and Ganzinger
extended with the sort techniques developed by 
Weidenbach. The superposition
calculus relies on a reduction ordering which is total on ground terms. For
SPASS we chose an extension of the Knuth-Bendix ordering that was
first presented by Peterson.
In addition to the usual inference, deletion and simplification rules, 
SPASS includes a rule for case analysis, called splitting. }}

ABSTRACT = {In this article first-order semantic tableaux and free variable tableaux are extended
with sorts. Sorts are sets of unary predicates.
They can be attached to variables. Semantically, the domain of a
variable is restricted to the intersection of the denotations of the attached predicates.
Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified quantifier
tableaux rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableaux
is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableaux
with sorts and free variable tableaux with sorts are proved sound, complete and more
suitable for mechanization than their standard counterparts without sorts.}}
